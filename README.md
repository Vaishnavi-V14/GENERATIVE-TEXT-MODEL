Overview of the project


Project: GENERATIVE-TEXT-MODEL



Objective


To develop a generative text model that creates coherent, contextually relevant, and high-quality text based on user-provided prompts, enabling applications like content creation, chatbots, and text completion.



Key Activities


•	Data Collection: Gather and preprocess large text datasets for training.

•	Model Selection: Choose appropriate architectures (e.g., GPT, LSTM, or Transformer-based models).

• Training: Train the model on the dataset to generate coherent text outputs.

•	Integration: Deploy the model into applications like chatbots, content generators, or summarization tools.

• Optimization: Enhance model efficiency, coherence, and response quality based on feedback and testing.



Technology Used


• Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras for building and training models.

•	APIs: OpenAI GPT, Cohere, or custom REST APIs for text generation.

•	Optimization Tools: Techniques like model quantization or pruning for efficient deployment.

•	Development Tools: Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit for creating user-facing interfaces.
